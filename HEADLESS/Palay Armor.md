The armor commonly worn by [[Palay Soldiers]], known as some of the best armor on the free side of [[Panry]]. It commonly contains a visor that emits a purple glow via [[Quantum Runes]]. 

This as well as the wide brimmed, cone shaped helmet can be seen as striking elements of the armor's design that are feared throughout the majority of [[Panry]].
