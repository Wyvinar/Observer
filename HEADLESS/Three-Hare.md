A small, bipedal mammal with three distinctive ears trailing down the center of their head towards the back of their neck. Known for their large, black beady eyes. 

They burrow much like rabbits, with a cowardly reputation due to their significant hearing range giving observers the impression that the hare commonly runs from nothing.

It is also known for being stunned when perceiving the considerable light emitting off the moon of [[Panry]] for reasons biological but of unknown origin.
