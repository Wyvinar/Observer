The exiled coalition is a country created after three prevalent nobles of the [[Murnang Empire]] were banished from the country, leading to a mass migration of the populace they were responsible for. As a direct consequence, the planes that stretch from the south of [[Panry]] up to the island of [[Reaching Teather]] is considered the territory of the [[System of Three Kings]] by the [[Murnang Empire]]. It is unknown as to if there are other [[Conscious observer]]s present on this land.

The Exiled Coalition is known to be difficult land to grow plantlife in, with the only abundant life being [[Coalition Bank]], and the weather being often destructive to any imported seed. The only abundant source of food besides this are the [[Tankores]], although they are incredibly difficult to kill. As a consequence to this, the [[System of Three Kings]] has only established one city on the landmass, finding it difficult to expand inwards without the minimal help provided to them by sympathetic merchants.
