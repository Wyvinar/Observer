The chain that is embedded deep within the northern area of [[Panry]], extending far into space with its origin point almost permanently obscured by [[Panry]]'s atmosphere. 

It is known to connect to a point of significant gravity which [[Panry]] orbits. 

The chain is known to actively move with enough pressure to break rigid structures built around it. The chain itself is not significantly strong considering the object's absurd size of the project.
