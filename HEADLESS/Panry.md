A small planet with shallow seas known for both orbiting and being directly attached to a large pivot point by the [[Panry Chain]] embedded in [[Reaching Teather]], heavy enough to sway the orbit of the planet.

It is theorized that Panry is in actuality a planet sized weapons made by unknown civilization with access to technology well above Panry itself. 

Panry's orb-like end is known for having a single small orbiting moon that casts considerable light on the ball of the planet.
