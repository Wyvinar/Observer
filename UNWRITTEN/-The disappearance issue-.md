Lungs burning, eyes dry but aching, secluded from the rest of the noise in the house. After months and months of waiting, dreading, moving it about the mind and attempting to ignore it, the expected had happened. She was dead. 

Closed casket, abstract funeral, we didn't know her faith but my father did know some of her commune. My aunt had been a colorful figure. She always hollered at the results of the football no matter the result. She was the loudest and brightest person in any room. It was as if she felt she had to be. As if she acted as the billows to her own flame while no one else would, playing the part people knew her as again and again until she was a flame inextinguishable.  In small moments you could see darkness, not in her but across the faces of others, when thinking of the things tied to her inseparably in their minds.

It was never clear what she had done, or if it was even her that did it. All I knew at the point prior to that call was that there were thick, white lines drawn at the funeral as the marble flooring split mourners into two groups. Her commune, and us. 

My father when asked on the subject would throw up a wall of ghost stories and comedy, tell us they "all shagged each other" and "drank goat piss", to gross out my siblings and halt further questioning. Asking anyone older than him was forbidden, one of those hard iron rules kept by stiff upper lips and truths so unspoken that hearing those over the age of sixty even acknowledge things tangentially related brought shock to anyone any younger. 

Regardless, it was in the study that, emotionally dry and shaken by the funeral, I received the phone call. It was the number for the crematorium. As is common procedure for my culture the extremely complicated last rites had been performed somewhere far from the funeral home. When I saw the labelled number flash on the phone, I tried to fight images of the six boxes out of my mind, of my poor family being robbed of each of their limbs and stored for safe keeping. No use, best pick up the phone as a distraction, everyone else is too busy with the wake. 

Hello, this is the crematorium, who am I speaking to? James Dalicy, can I help? Are you related to Margrecia J. Dalicy? Yes, yes I am. We're awaiting delivery for their casket, has there been a delay?

I remember being crumpled up, leaning against the wall with two legs on a nearby chair. Those last words seemed to set my spine straight, as if set with iron rods. We had seen a large truck be loaded with the casket, with how protected corpses are in my culture, the prospect that it had gone missing was deeply unnerving. I said in a voice brought to level almost exclusively out of exhaustion: 

I will be right with you.

The rest of family were individually drunk off their asses beyond operating a car, despite the atmosphere of the wake being near riotous I had remained entirely sober due to my present state. And so, dryly, I mentioned out loud to no one that I was leaving, took the keys to my car, and drove to the crematorium. The winds of fear drove me forward, unimpeded as they were by my dried and barren emotional state. My right breaking foot  remained entirely idle as I pressed the acceleration and clutch, climbing gears and barreling irresponsibly fast down empty roads. As I slotted myself into the crematorium car park, I noted the only car accompanying me was a single small staff car, outlined in orange by the setting sun.

I pulled myself shaking from my car and composed myself in the golden glow. Steadily, resolutely and with as much of myself as I could muster I walked towards the door of the large, rounded metal building only to find its small door.... open. Unlocked. All of me shuddered.

Slowly I opened the door, all the lights were off, the orange of the sunlight was poorly mimicked by the orange-red of the furnace that lay in front of me. As I moved inside, the entrance corridor opened up to show a large open space with tools on every wall. Things that hack, saw and dissect. In front of the fire there was space to tie a body, with specifically ordained measurements and guides surrounding it. With some horror I noted the red at each of the cutting points. 

As my gaze wandered, as if they had been waiting for me, six felt boxes were held in a corner of the otherwise circular room, as if deforming the structure of the building itself. The darker parts of my mind muttered: the middle box for the torso and head, one for every limb.....

Something clattered fast down the corridor from which I entered. I looked over my shoulder to see a shadow spill its way towards me in the flame of that great, dreadful flame. I tried to duck myself out of site and around the wooden table. 

A young man with two legs hobbled into the room, holding a wooden stick out in front of them. With a practiced authority they requested for me to emerge slowly. Recognizing the voice from the phone I sprung up with my hands behind my head, quickly announcing my name as if it had been summoned out of me. The man lowered his improvised weapon and quickly apologized, stating he had been thoroughly searching the building after what he referred to as "the disappearance issue" and must have left the door unlocked. 

After a brief conversation my worst suspicions were confirmed, the casket containing my aunt had left the funeral home before, according an application on the man's smartphone with an almost comedic resemblance to a postal tracker, the truck my aunt was stored in was abandoned off a road three and half miles from here. The man admitted that due to his religious duties, he would be unable to resume a normal rate of work at his post until this was resolved. He decided that we would both drive to the site at which the truck had been abandoned an attempt to find tracks from there, I knew it was my place to be reluctantly dragged on this journey, even if I had to physically fight myself back into my car.

The man took his own car, as it was apparently better adapted to his condition. We both drove towards the found location, my unease building like pressure on my spine more and more the closer we came to the site. Eventually, we parked neatly behind the van, both leaving our vehicles to find the large truck had been abandoned half in a ditch with its cargo removed. The sun now fully set, we could see in our headlights that a small path had chewed its way haphazardly into the patch of woods bordering the road. 

I stared at the small, bending cut in the forest with apprehension, then without a word my two legged companion pulled out a torch with his free hand and moved towards the path. We both wandered through the dark, taking care not to trip over roots, the crematorium man leading with the surprising deftness of his cane several passes ahead of myself. I thought despite my mounting terror to question whether or not the man had "experience in the field" but the laughable thought was shunned from my mind as the forest path opened up.

Grey pillars loomed over the path, and we found ourselves at the mouth of a burial site, grey headstones hidden from view by the dense forest and now revealed to us.  Each of the individual burials had decorative stone panels half a foot high, the patterns of which drew me towards them in an attempt to extract some sort of meaning amid the surrounding terror. 

I discovered with horror that the coffins were unburied, instead black obelisk-like caskets sat within their grave-holes. When I looked behind me, the two legged man was gone. 

My legs bolted into the dark. Past graves and graves, deep into the hidden cemetery. I saw figures dart away from one grave as I charged through that terrible place. It was all I could do to stop myself barreling over all three of my legs as I stopped in front of the grave they had surrounded. For a moment, my eyes fixed themselves on the bare corpse of my aunt. She had a circle carved into her forehead, dried blood caked around it. I covered my mouth in a quick gasp. 

And then, I blinked. And she wasn't there. I stepped back in bewildered shock. I blinked again. There the body lay. Slowly, as if sensing a pattern, I stood blinking, glancing away, looking about myself and then back to the corpse that was once family. Every time I looked away, she disappeared. If I looked away again, she would return. 

For but a moment, I reached out to touch the symbol on her forehead that had created dark red blood flow down her laying head. 

Then a hand grabbed my head from behind and pulled me into darkness. That's the last thing I remember.
