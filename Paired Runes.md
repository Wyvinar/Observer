A use for [[Quantum Runes]] in which a Seen Rune and an Unseen Rune are created with identical functions. The creation of this orientation of runes allows for runes to be linked together, allowing for the runes to consider each other as part of the same object regardless of how far apart they are.

It should be noted that a paired runes use their [[Conscious observer]] as a conduit, with the direct consequence of this being that the use of too many Paired runes or using two of the same structure of paired runes can cause [[Sickness of Angle]].

The continuation of a paired runes functionality following their [[Conscious observer]]'s death is the source of much debate, and often plays into theories regarding [[The blinded]].
