Quantum Runes are a form of marking that can be made with a tool known as an [[Inscriber]]. They are known to be able to cause supernatural effects when shaped in specific ways, these effects being different depending on the shape of the rune, by way of channeling [[Absence]].

There are two different types of marking that can be made within a quantum rune:

**Seen Markings:**
These markings only channel energy when observed, therefore only activate under observation by a [[Conscious observer]].

**Unseen Markings:**
These Markings only channel energy when not being observed, therefore only activating when not observed by a [[Conscious observer]].


It should be noted that only a [[Conscious observer]] is capable of creating quantum runes, and that merely marking a quantum rune's pattern with an [[Inscriber]] through other means will not cause that rune to display any effects.
